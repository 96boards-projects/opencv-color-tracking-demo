Starting to get pieces of OpenCV working and storing here for now

## Component 1: colorIsolationApp.py
This is a python script that allows a user to manually tune HSV min and max parameters for plugging into an OpenCV application later.  
This was tested on Dragonboard 820c currently with only a USB camera.
